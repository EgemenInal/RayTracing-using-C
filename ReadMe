Final project for Intro. to Computer Graphics. 

Goal for the project was to determine how much of a computational power is necessary to achieve decent looking ray traced environments and comparing between them.





Type make in the terminal and run the program with ./raytrace
it will take a few second after its done it will display the time and give you the picture as out.ppm file
